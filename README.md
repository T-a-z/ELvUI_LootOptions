#ELvUI_LootOptions
###Custom datatext to manage Loot Options

This is a plugin for ELvUI, it will not work on its own.

This addon will add a new datatext that allows you to see and easily change loot method/options while also providing a way of quickly rolling.
Just assign this datatext to any of your panels and you're good to go!

- __Left Mouse button:__ Roll 1-100
- __Right Mouse button:__ Change loot options
